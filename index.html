	<h2><img src="template 4.png" width="25" height="25">faith: the great reversal</h2>

	<p>The cross was a symbol of death and terror, one of the most gruesome forms of capital punishment ever devised. Then, in the first century, something remarkable happened... The Great Reversal is how I like to think of it... Someone claiming blasphemous things about Himself was brutally executed by the political and religious leaders of the day along with the masses... But remarkably, this tragic and suffering Man didn't stay dead. And since that wondrous, mysterious day, reality has never been the same (see: paradigm shift): this same cross has meant life and Life to the Fullest to countless people - including myself.</p>

<br>
<br>

	<p>My has shaped and informed me in ways that I cannot even begin to explain. Nonetheless, I will attempt to do some justice to it here:</p>

	<p>I was raised by loving parents who consistently displayed the love of Jesus to me. My dad was often heavily involved as a layperson and deacon in the church, a privilege that I hope to have someday. And yet despite this excellent upbringing, I mainly related to God in a mentally assenting way, acknowledging that He created the world and had some general involvement within it... but nothing more. It would take some more movement in my heart to bring me into relationship with the God of the universe.</p>

	<p>Thankfully, this work reached a tipping point in my middle school years, most acutely during Good Friday of either 6th or 7th grade. Watching a short clip from "The Passion of the Christ", particularly of Christ being nailed to the cross, stirred a question in me: "Why?? Why did Jesus have to go through that much pain and suffering?" It was at this point I really began to recognize and consider my sin, even though I was a relatively obedient child. Every single person that has ever lived has actually been in rebellion against God, including me. But that wasn't the end of the story... Jesus - Who is God Himself - cared so much that He came as a man so that He could be the one condemned for rebellion and we would be considered loyal to God. And not only do we derive this ultimate benefit from His ultimate suffering, Jesus rose from the dead in victory and later went directly back to Heaven. His Holy Spirit continues God's work all over the world today in spectacular fashion, calling people from every identity to follow Him in Love and Truth.</p>

	<p>I don't think I understood the full weight of those things (which is the Gospel by the way!) on that night (and I'm still growing in that as you read), but it was the germination of a beautiful seed. Since then, countless things have happened. I've grown tremendously alongside brothers and sisters at Friday Night Youth Group in Wilmington Community Evangelical Church, learning to surrender my whole life - career, sex life, family, shame, and all - to the One Who holds the whole world in His hands. I've connected in amazing ways with my Columbia Faith and Action family, learning about the integrated life of faith and appreciating how liberal arts and the humanities tango with Christianity. I've come across loving and amazing city churches such as Trinity Grace Church UWS along with Inspire Church in London. Only God knows what's next!</p>

<br>

	<p>Also, with regards to my denominational/theological leanings: Evangelical (though I prefer "orthodox") Presbyterian-Baptist-Reformed fusion with a dash of Pentecostal as well as tremendous respect for orthodox Anglicans and Catholics... if that means anything to you</p>

<div id="music">
	<h2><img src="template 3.png" width="25" height="25">music: multi-instrumentalist</h2>

	<p>I love music, but I didn't always love it. I was clasically trained on the violin since the age of 4, but loathed it for far too many years. Later, I picked up the tenor saxophone, followed by the bass guitar. In late high school, I decided to give the acoustic guitar a try and have loved it ever since. Now in college, my drum set skills are gradually improving and I'm gaining interest in playing piano.</p>

	<p>If you didn't guess already, my current musical love is multi-instrumentalism, particularly in the realm of praise music. Here's some information about my experience and equipment on each instrument.</p>

	<p>Violin - I need to check what kind it is - many years of Suzuki Method, recent work in improvisation</p>

	<p>Saxophone - donated to my high school - high school concert band</p>

	<p>Bass Guitar - Yamaha something or another with DR colored strings - praise team experience with some rock riffs and improv</p>

	<p>Acoustic Guitar - Breedlove Solo - jamming and leading praise teams, specialty in half-capo tuning</p>

	<p>Drum Set - some sticks and some hot rods, but no drums - jamming and some basic praise team</p>

	<p>Piano - wherever I can find one - "Mary Had a Little Lamb"</p>

<div id="languages">
<h2><img src="template 5.png" width="25" height="25">language: polyglot wannabe</h2>

	<p>The character above is the Chinese character <i>wen</i>, which can be translated as "language" or "culture" depending on the context. This dual meaning actually translates very well for my particular interest, which is both in language and the culture that is intimately tied with it.</p>

<br>

	<p>English is my native language having been born and raised in the States. For a long time, [Mandarin] Chinese was a loathed bi-product of my heritage, but later miraculously became a love of mine in college. I had the blessing of studying in Beijing at the Minzu University of China and will continue to improve my Chinese as much as I can. Spanish is a rather distant third language, having taken a semester at Columbia and a few years in high school. After this, I have under my command a few phrases in French, German, and Uyghur. I will also be taking Attic Greek at Columbia with the hopes of grasping the New Testament and some of the classics in their original language (or variants of it, eg. Koine Greek for the NT).</p>

	<p>As you can probably gather from this, I really want to be a polyglot, or one who can speak multiple languages, but even my second language of Chinese still needs tremendous work. One thing at a time I suppose.</p>

<h2><img src="template 2.png" width="25" height="25">education: cavaliers and lions and ??? oh my</h2>

	<p>B.A. <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu" target="_blank">Computer Science</a>, <a href="http://www.columbia.edu" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>, 2015.
	<br>
	High School Diploma, <a href="http://www.middletownhs.org" target="_blank">Middletown High School</a>, 2011.
	</p>

	<p>My undergraduate work was done at Columbia University, specifically the liberal arts school: Columbia College. Within the CS department, I mostly have experience in systems programming in C (Operating Systems, Unix/Socket/Deprecated-Web Programming, Network Security) and teaching as a TA for Data Structures in Java. Some people are a bit shocked that I'm studying Computer Science at a liberal arts school, but it has really proved to be an incredible experience. While gaining practical skills for the job market, I've been given incredibly rich food-for-thought that have both challenged and nourished my mind and soul. These have mostly come from Columbia College's Core Curriculum, spanning Western literature, philosophy, music, and art. I've also greatly enjoyed learning Chinese language and random parts of history.</p>

	<p>After graduation, I'm hoping to work in either Product Management, IT, or Education Technology... or some combination of the three! An interesting graduate school program for several years down the line is MIT's Technology and Policy Program. Of course, one step at a time.</p>

	<p>And if you were wondering about the title, my high school mascot was a cavalier, college was a lion.</p>
