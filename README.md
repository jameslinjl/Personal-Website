Personal-Website
================

This is the code for my current personal website. It serves two primary purposes:
  1) Giving me a space to more thoroughly learn HTML and CSS, which I have neglected
  2) serve as a portal for other links that can provide more information about me.
  
The main features are the constant column on the left with my picture and buttons
to lead to other links. Also highlighted are the large buttons, which act as
internal links to the content below. User experience elements include the use of
Google Fonts for smoother font, JS for smooth scrolling, and a single page webpage
in general, just like all the hip kids have these days.

For an example that is most likely active, go to www.columbia.edu/~jl3782 . This
is my public university profile. I may put in a bit more work, such as adding more
buttons and content, but at the moment I feel satisfied as far as the HTML, CSS, and
JS go.
